## A Path / Facebook style UINavigationController replacement.
### Drop this in, and set the left/rightController object and thats it.

This is very early and not ready for prime time. Bounce logic sucks and pushing side controllers has not been tested.

Only tested on iPhone with controllers narrower than the screen.

## Documentation
